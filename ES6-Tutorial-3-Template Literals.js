//Template literals

let name = "Scooby Doo";
//instead of ' + name + ', use ${name}, 
//console.log(`My favorite person is ${name}`);

//template literals allows one to include snippes of javascript i

//another examle
let a = 5;
let b = 7;

//console.log(`My favorite person is ${a + b} because he smells good`);
//notice above that you can add the vaules of a and b here, bu t
//is not recommended. one should always seperate logic for formatting
//so you'd have:
let e = 5; 
let f = 7; 
let g = e + f; 
//console.log(`the sum of e and f is ${g}`);
